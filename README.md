# BookBank

Book Bank is a mobile application that allows owners to record the books they have and loan them out to borrowers.

In general, a user can be both an owner of their own books and a borrower of someone else's books.
A borrower can borrow an available book by making a request for it.
The owner can accept such a request.
When the book is handed over, the book becomes borrowed.
The owner can denote when a borrowed book is returned and available again.
